## Adversarial Chess Agents

In this repository, I made several different algorithms to play the game of chess. My main algorithms were Minimax, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and TD-Leaf Reinforcement learning.
My ches engine utilizes the bitboard structure.

## Repository Structure
The repository includes the following files:

### 1. `algorithms.py`  
This file contains all versions of my agents
- Minimax V1-7
- Monte Carlo V1 and 2
- RL Agent

### 2. `comparisons.py`  
This file contains the code to run my tournaments as well as veiw the results

### 3. `demo.py`  
This file provides and access point to test all agents. It has functionality to play from different positions and depths

### 4. `problems.py`  
This file contains my bitboard chess engine
- All relative fucntions that are used in the game are encapulated in the Board class
